Let's start fresh for the automation tool. 

Okay, so first of all, we have the comparator class, ExcelFileProcessor class. Which does it's operation based on the button used in the UI. Now, I want to automate this. 

I know last time you gave me a code for regressionTester but we need to modify a lot. 

So what happens is that when we are trying to leverage the existing class, it is not storing files at the correct location.
